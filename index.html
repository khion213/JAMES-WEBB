        <h1>James Webb Space Telescope</h1>
        <p class="description">
            The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an advanced space observatory launched on December 25, 2021, at a cost of approximately $10 billion USD.<br>
            JWST is considered the successor to the Hubble Telescope and is designed to explore the universe using infrared light, allowing it to see deeper into space and reveal details invisible to visible light.

    <section class="image-section">
        <img src="images/IMAGE1.png" alt="Webb Deep Field">
        <h3>1. Webb Deep Field (SMACS 0723)</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The deepest and sharpest infrared image of the universe, showing thousands of galaxies as they appeared 13.1 billion years ago.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific context:</strong> A distant galaxy cluster acting as a gravitational lens, allowing observation of more distant galaxies behind it.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>2. Carina Nebula (NGC 3324)</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An image showing the “cosmic cliffs,” a star-forming region with complex structures.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific context:</strong> One of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky, located 7,600 light-years away, containing massive stars.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="image-section">
        <img src="images/IMAGE3.png" alt="Stephan's Quintet">
        <h3>3. Stephan's Quintet</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An image of a group of five galaxies, four of which are interacting gravitationally.</p>
        <p><strong>Scientific context:</strong> The first compact galaxy group ever discovered, located about 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus.</p>
